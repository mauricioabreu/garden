#+title: TCP_NODELAY

A few days ago I was having a chat with a friend asking about the behavior of turning TCP_NODELAY on and off.

TCP_NODELAY is one of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) flags you can set while opening a TCP connection. What does it do? Before explaining this flag, we need to understand why it was created.

** Why Nagle?

The world has changed a lot since the TCP was created. Today's internet is quick and more reliable than before. We have learned a lot since then - we even improved our applications to be more resilient to network failures. But it was not ever like this.

Nagle's algorithm, created by John Nagle, had the goal to improve the networking performance by avoiding sending small packets through the network. Instead, it buffered the data before sending.
